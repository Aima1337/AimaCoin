desc="Perhaps the most fantastic of yellow gems, yellow diamonds are gaining popularity. These gems range from muted brownish hues to vivid yellows with hints of orange or green, and combine beautiful color with the durability and brilliance of diamond. Yellow hues arenâ€™t as uncommon as other diamond colors, but can reach higher levels of saturation than most fancy colored diamonds. The high demand for these gems keeps prices comparable to white diamonds. However, the four Cs of fancy colored yellow diamonds vary greatly from standards for colorless or white diamonds. Before you consider buying a yellow diamond, learn about their distinct value factors."
conditions="Fancy yellow diamonds are usually more expensive than white diamonds, but are often significantly less expensive than other fancy colored diamonds. A 0.7 carat fancy vivid yellow diamond may be around $6,500."
