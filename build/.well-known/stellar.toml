desc="Green diamonds are considered one of the rarer colors within the Fancy Diamond world. In fact, the only colors that are more difficult to find are red, pink, blue, violet and orange. Because of green's extreme rarity, these diamonds are often far pricier than other colored diamonds.Emerald is a gemstone and a variety of the mineral beryl colored green by trace amounts of chromium and/or sometimes vanadium. Beryl has a hardness of 7.5â€“8 on the Mohs scale. Most emeralds are highly included, so their toughness (resistance to breakage) is classified as generally poor."
conditions="1 carat of low-grade emerald can cost as little as $200, while 1 carat of a high-quality gem can fetch up to $18,000. Synthetic emeralds are much cheaper, with even the highest quality costing around $350 for 1 carat."
